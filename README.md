# My Portfolio

Main inspiration from [Alejandro Aspinwall](https://aaspinwall.com/) and [Jen Simmons](https://labs.jensimmons.com/2016/)

# Landing Page

This landing page section is heavily insipired by [Jen Simmons](https://labs.jensimmons.com/2016/).
I mainly emulated the layout of the Jen Simmons' lab header but changed several things, mainly:

- The landing page's scale when viewed in larger screen
- Changed layout for small screens
- Overall spacing of elements in response to the screen size as I see fit
- Background color

CSS Typewriter Effect Animation made by [Geoff Graham](https://codepen.io/geoffgraham) from [codepen.io](https://codepen.io/geoffgraham/pen/jrWwWM)
I tweaked several things in this animation, mainly:

- The color of the cursor
- The speed of animation
- Number of loops the cursor animation plays
